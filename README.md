- Handle content versioning
- Copy and move content between locations
- Manage configurations

## Cursor AI setup

To use this MCP server with Cursor AI, go to `Cursor Settings`, `MCP` and a `New global MCP server`. Add this entry to your list of `mcpServers`:

```
"da-live-admin": {
 "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "https://github.com/meejain/mcp-da-live-admin"
  ],
  "env": {
    "DA_ADMIN_API_TOKEN": "your_api_token_here"
  }
}
```

In the chat, you can then ask things like: `Via the DA Admin, give me the list of resources in <your_org>/<your_repo>/<path>`.
